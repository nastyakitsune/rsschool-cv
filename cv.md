# Hello there!

## My name is **Nastya**. I'm here to learn Obj-C & Swift.

I am really interested in Apple ecosystem that's why I've decided to dive into mobile app development.

What I hope to learn:

- obj-c
- swift
- how to build & deploy apps
- how to manage certificates & profiles correctly (for big teams too)
- etc.

I have some experience in development already but it's not so relevant.

Thank you so much for reading all this information ðŸ™ƒ
